# Project Documentation

This directory contains living documentation for the support platform.

- See `apis.md` for API endpoints and examples
- See `architecture.md` for system design and request flows
- See `database.md` for schema and ER diagrams
- See `development.md` for setup, environment, and conventions

Conventions
- Diagrams use Mermaid. GitHub and many IDEs render Mermaid directly.
- Examples are minimal and copy-paste friendly.
- Keep this folder up-to-date with each change (PRs should update docs).
